# Summary

I made the holes to fit 3 mm screws but out door deck screws should fit too. 

I was tired of buying new sprinklers every week i had the lawn mowed so i made these.
They make the sprinklers spray easier and the mower can see them easier to not run them over. and if he does, the mower blades skipp over the sprinklers. They seem to take 4 or 5 blade hits before they break. But some heat and acetone and they are back together. 

# Print Settings

Printer Brand: Robo 3D
Printer: R1 ABS + PLA Model
Rafts: No
Supports: No

Notes: 
i am in utah and when i print this i had to be at 243c nozzle and 80c for the bed with abs glue on the bed for adhesion and easy part removal.

I printed it in dark green to match my lawn but still protect my sprinklers from my lawn mower.

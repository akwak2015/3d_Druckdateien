# Summary

I did not really like the native hood of the Anycubic i3 MEGA hotend. Basically, the air ducts of the fans are quite ugly. They made a lot of noise when the air passes through them.
I decided to get rid of the metal casing and make this

For this modification, you will need:
+ 4 M3 nuts
+ 4 M3 * 12..16 screws 
+ turbofan, for example:
https://www.aliexpress.com/item/5015-12V-Cooling-Turbo-Fan-Brushless-3D-Printer-Parts-2Pin-For-Makerbot-Reprap-Prusa-i3-DC/32815755495.html
or
https://www.aliexpress.com/item/DC-12V-50mm-Blow-Radial-Cooling-Fan-Hotend-Extruder-Cooler-For-RepRap-3D-Printer/32811709677.html
+ 2 screws for attaching it (such as used to mount a fan in a computer)

The casing is assembled using filament pieces that need to be inserted into the holes. Can be fixed with cyanoacrylate.

That's all. Now, by reducing the inertia of the head and better cooling the print zone, I can print at higher speeds.

16.02.2018 UPDATE:
Added grille front. 
While print ABS it's to much air blows down the hotend and print delaminates.
Grille helps a little.

01.03.2018 UPDATE:
Please use this firmware mod https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2732424 to have +12V at FAN0 port OR/AND adjust output voltage of main power unit with VR to 13.5 volt.

Peace for everyone!

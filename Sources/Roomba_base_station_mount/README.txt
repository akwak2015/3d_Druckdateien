# Summary

I did not find a nice Roomba wall mount that had all the features that I wanted. To further hone my skills with Fusion 360, I made it fully parametrized and fancy! To this end you can download the f3d file and set the following user parameters (check the "Change Parameters"):
- **wallToBase:** the length between the lower lip of the base station and the wall, this way you can bridge a gap or a baseboard.
- **baseboardHeight:** the height of the baseboard or zero if you do not have this
- **screwDiameter:** the diameter of the screw thread
- **screwHeadDiameter:** the diameter of the screw head
- **slant:** the slant of your wall (my walls are not straight) and add 1.5 deg slant of the base station itself.

If you do not have Fusion 360 or you just quickly want a STL file with the correct parameters, ask in the comments and I will quickly generate one for you!

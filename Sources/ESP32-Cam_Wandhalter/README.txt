# Summary

This is my cam mount for my octoprint setup inside the enclosure.
I have a Logitech C615 which works flawlessly with octoprint. This camera has a typica camera thread on it's holder.
(1/4 UNC) 

if you use another cam with 1/4 UNC keep in mind the distance from the wall you mount to the edge of the plate the camera is attached to it is 25mm

Distance from Wall to the middle of the screw is 43mm

Logitech C615 has a moveable base so I had no need to build the mount flexible or moveable.


>>>Update 2017/07/20<<< 
Due to people which are interested in this and due to the fact that this mount could be used for every device which has a default "small" 1/4 UNC camera thread, 
I added "Wallmount_Strong.stl"
The original wallmount is very thin and shouldn't be used for more than e.g. a Logitech C615.
Also you should make sure if you attach it to your enclosure that it is strong enough. 
Due to the thin connection between wall and camera mount it would start swinging with negative effect on the picture of the cam if the enclosure e.g. is too leightweight and moves due to the printer movements.

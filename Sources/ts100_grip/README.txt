# Summary

The ts100 soldering iron is a great iron but I have always thought that the grip wasn't very good and I was always scared to loose grip and touch the hot tip, so I designed this grip!

I designed three attachment systems, choose the one of your liking:

The standard version uses the head long screw to keep its place, but some soldering irons doesn't come with this long screw.

The screw version needs a longer screw, which joints together the iron tip, the iron itself and the grip.

The V2 version is a little bit longer and its hold itself using the gap between the soldering iron and the tip. This may be a problem if the iron get too hot, as the plastic will melt, although I've never had that problem.

The part is quite small and precise, it must be printed in the best print quality. I used 0.06mm layer height.

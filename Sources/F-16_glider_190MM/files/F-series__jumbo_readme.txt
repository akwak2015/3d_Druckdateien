Description: A high performance low aspect ratio glider with supersonc fighter styling, ideal for long looping flights and long glides.

Plastic: ABS  

Layers: .15mm

Fill: 30%-40% 

Perimeters: 2

Solid Layers: 2

filament use / weight (3mm) : approx 2000MM

Orientation: 
first layer lengthwise (0 degrees to fuselage), altrenate by 90 degrees. A 45 degree (or non right angle) axis will cause asymetrical wing warping under load (bad).

Build Notes: 
Allow to cool before carefully removing from build platform. The wings are easily deformed during removal, and must be absoultely symmetrical for proper flight. Removal with a very thin plastic spatula (print one!) is preferred. Test fit and trim if necesary prior to final assembly with a very small amount of CA Glue.

Flight Notes: 
The F series are roll sensitive due to their low aspect ratio wings.

Launching is by hand or with 2 ea 1/8" x 8" (3.5mm) rubber band. Rubber band launch is reccomended for best results. 

Test and adjust by hand launching first. Some of the models are difficult to hand lauch and should be tested with a 1/16" rubber band instead.

A slight elevator - up reflex is required for flight. This is accomplished by latching the elevons up on the relex tabs on the aft end of the fuselage. these tabs may be adjusted by filing to achieve desired flight characteristics. After the desired flight profile is attained, a tiny drop of glue will prevent the elevons from moving from their latched position. 

To correct turning or spiraling, differential elevator control (elevon) is preferred, though some aileron bending may be needed if the wings are warped from improper bed removal. Carefully bend this in with finger pressure, but avoid creasing or excessive strain. 

A gradual test/adjust cycle is recommended.

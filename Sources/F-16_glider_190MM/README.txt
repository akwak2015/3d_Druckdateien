# Summary

Flip down your visors and inflate your g-suits, jet jockeys....this 190MM F-16 "squinty scale" glider is sure to push your printer into the "danger zone". (sorry...I couldnt help it) An excellent flyer, this is one of my all time favorites for big air. If you like this glider, be sure to check out http://threedsy.com for printing tips on our blog, as well as more printable planes and an unbranded version of this one.  

You will need a launcher ( http://http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:95765 )and a pair of 8" x 1/8" rubber bands in tandem to get enough thrust to explore the flight envelope of this glider.

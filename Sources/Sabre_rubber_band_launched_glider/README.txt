# Summary

A next-gen V-tailed glider, the Sabre follows in the footsteps of the monarch and stratos, but with more efficient aerodynamics, and easier post print adjustment. 

Long looping flights and tight aerobatics are sure to delight all ages!  

The premium performance long winged Katana  and the unbranded Sabre are available at http://threedsy.com

Too big? A similar Full sized glider that can be printed on a 100MM bed can be found at http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:300168

# Print Settings

Rafts: Doesn't Matter
Supports: Doesn't Matter
Resolution: .2mm layers
Infill: 30%

Notes: 
Printing Instructions:

ABS or PET is preferred for durability.

Bed must be leveled and printer adjusted to produce good single layer prints. Measurement and calibration of your filament is highly recommended.

Use .2mm or .1mm layer height, 30% infill, with 2 outer perimeters.

Designed to print with 0.5mm or smaller nozzle.

Orient model so that first layer infill is printed parallel to the span of the wings. Diagonal infill in the wings will result in a model that will not easily fly straight.

Use a spatula or similar tool to carefully lift the print from the print bed. The wings are easily damaged by bending during removal. A printable one is included in the zip file, along with more comprehensive instructions.
